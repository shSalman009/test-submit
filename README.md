Hi Salman,
Thank you for your invitation. We have completed analyzing your codes.

# What we really find impressive is

- The Layout Concept. Which you are awared of;

## And there were some notable issues which I think you should get aware of

- There was a change overlay and cancel icon on the Image, which we found missing;
- The Product and Planes are not that much dynamic. (Items are not being filtered depending on their type)
- You Have ignored the VAT

**For Which, we would like to put you on hold for now.ðŸ˜¥** But:

# We are not rejecting you. ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„

We will reach out to you once we get some project that we find suitable for you.
